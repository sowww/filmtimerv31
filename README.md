# Film Timer v3.1
My best application for android. I created it to help me in my work.

## Controls
The application is controlled by volume buttons:
* __Volume up__ - start timer
* __Volume down__ - stop timer

## Working principle
Enabling the timer starts the service. This service controls the work of the timer and notifications. It's the only proper way to work in background.
